// Demonstration of alternatives for how
// to allocate and initialize an array.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  // A literal string evaluates to a (constant) char pointer.
  // You can index off this pointer, like any other pointer.
  char c = "abcdefg"[ 4 ];
  printf( "%c\n", c );

  // This gives us two common ways to initialize
  // string variables.

  // Really make a new array.
  char str1[] = "abc123";

  // Just copy a pointer to a literal string.
  char *str2 = "abc123";

  // Since str1 and str2 both look like pointers, we can often use
  // these as if they are equivalent (but they're not).
  printf( "%s\n", str1 );
  printf( "%s\n", str2 );

  // We can use similar syntax to initialize other array types (but
  // literal strings have special support in C that other arrays don't)
  int list1[] = { 5, 10, 15, 20 };
  int *list2 = (int []){ 7, 14, 21, 28 };

  // Here also, we can use these as if they're the same.
  for ( int i = 0; i < 4; i++ )
    printf( "%d\n", list1[ i ] );

  for ( int i = 0; i < 4; i++ )
    printf( "%d\n", list2[ i ] );

  // But they're not the same.  list1 is an array, list2 is a pointer.
  printf( "%zd %zd\n", sizeof( list1 ), sizeof( list2 ) );  
}
// A couple of extra lines
// at the end.
