# C Projects (Part 1)

A collection of various mini-projects written in C, with the intention of becoming familiar with C.
I have another repo written in C, which was written with the intention of becoming familiar with OS concepts like scheduling, multithreading, etc. However this repo is currently private. Contact me for access to that repo.

P2 is a mathematical parser. Meaning it can read things like "5 * 2" or "5 / 2" and output the result like a calculator.

## P3
P3 is similar to the "grep" command, and parses a line using tokenization in order to find a specific identifier.

## P4
P4 is a calendar/course catalog command-line implementation.

## P5
P5 is an encrypter and decrypter using AES Block Encryption.

## P6
